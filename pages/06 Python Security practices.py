         for environment mangement lockfiles: 
         A lockfile can contain dependency version information that is valid across multiple platforms and Python interpreter versions. 
         Lockfiles are important because they allow for repeatable and deterministic installations. This is most beneficial for applications 
         living at the end of the dependency chain. It can also be useful for internal development and testing of libraries so that 
            other issues can be isolated and reproduced.
         -> many recommendations for uploading to pypi and packaging -> not go into this
         - go through Workflow tools assumption many of you use python for personal projects maby not yet into packaging and publishing tools but still upload code to github 
         and collaborate across public repos
         -> pipenv
         -> poetry
         -> pip-tools
         there are others: like hatch, pdm, rye.. not time to go into all. 
            What we can do: Use lockfiles because version pins, 
         this can f.e. mitigate squat attacks, avoids dependency confusion.
