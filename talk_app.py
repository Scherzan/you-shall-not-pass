# This talk is going to be about practices and tools you can use when coding mainly 
# to make sure you implement basic security precautions right.
# The talk will be more for you who got into python from other backgrounds than software development
# and who started to use python more as the tool of choice for applications in your area of interest
# If you got into python with a software dev background or you know all pypi and owasp security standards and cheat sheets by heart
# you won't find anything new. Maby you will enjoy the cartoons?

# Implementing security often feels like a chore especially when we are ecited to see our ideas in action
# Also technology evolves so quickly and usuall we know so little about what software and dependencies we are actually using,
# so following security news and react to the relevant stuff seems cumbersome and hard to do on our own.
# Luckily, you are here, hopefully not because someone broke into your device, and we have some time to dive into tools and practices 
# but first a few words on Roman and myself:

# Roman you want to start?

# Like Roman I am a ml engineer at the same company and we work hard to bring 
# the benefits of ml and functioning technology to public institutions
