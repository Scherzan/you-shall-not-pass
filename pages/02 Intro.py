Storyline \n


How many heard about the typosquatting attack beginning of march? \n
How many have pip installed some of these library in the last year? \n
How many of you do typos? \n
-> expect every hand to go up actually \n


There are some people earn money by tricking others on the internet -> they use common human behaviour to their advantage \n
-> reason why you should care a bit about security -> we will look at practices and toolboxes you can leverage to make this easy \n

break down security -> means? \n
1. actors in the internet mostly interested in your money -> part of a company maby in internal workings of your company -> higher position in your account and priveleges that come with them in order to get to company digital assets and leverage them again for money \n

how do they do that? \n
different attacks +  social engineering \n
-> deeper into type of attacks at the end of the session for now: \n
most common type of attack with success and recent development more of them (check source) \n
multi-stage-attack -> multi step approach mainly looking for information trying to get into the system by a low level vulnerable entry point
to maintain and widen acces to the internal system gaining acces to privileges in the system to get acces to data they can use for profit
again in detail later on the single steps and how to counter them individually \n
-> shows attackers leverages many vulnerabilities -> goal is to know how to minimize entrypoints or wholes thet can be used by others \n

going further we will lokk into: IT-Security principles in general, coding principles apply to python, python specific vulnerabilities \n



2. Coding practices -> similar to updates on your system -> keep python version and dependencies up to date

- code analysis, 
- input validation 
- dependency vulnerabilities
- other
- other

3. Python specific:

- cve
- showcases

strengthen code security? -> toolbox summary


promised multi-stage-attack details ->
look deeper into the case of typosquatting -> explain the case
