## Exploits

Def: Attack using an vulnerability
Vulnerability is only the theoretical possibility to break a system
exploit is the piece of code actually using it
examples:

- Buffer Overflow Exploits:
    - often caused by vulnerability in input validation
    - uses large input size to exceed memory and access areas beyond the buffer
    - 2003, the SQL Slammer worm exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server to spread rapidly across the internet

- SQL Injection Exploits:
    - badly sanitized input for queries
    - 2014, the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL allowed attackers to exploit a flaw in the implementation of the TLS protocol, leading to the exposure of sensitive information, including private keys, usernames, and passwords.

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploits:
    - inject malicious scripts onto websites
    - steal cookies, redirect to phishing sites, and more
    - 2018, the Magecart group used XSS attacks to compromise thousands of websites by injecting malicious scripts into e-commerce platforms, stealing payment card details

- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Exploits:
    - Act maliciously on an authenticated users behalf
    - 2013, the Yahoo Mail CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users, enabling them to send emails

- Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploits:
    - execute arbitrary code on another machine
    - 2017, the WannaCry ransomware exploited a vulnerability in the Windows SMB protocol (EternalBlue), encrypting files and demanding ransom payments from affected users.

- Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Exploits:
    - overload a service with a massive amount of accesses
    - 2016, the Mirai botnet launched a series of massive DDoS attacks disrupting internet services for millions of users by overwhelming DNS servers with a flood of malicious traffic.
