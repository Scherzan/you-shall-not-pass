#         A lockfile can contain dependency version information that is valid across multiple platforms and Python interpreter versions. 
#         Lockfiles are important because they allow for repeatable and deterministic installations. This is most beneficial for applications 
#         living at the end of the dependency chain. It can also be useful for internal development and testing of libraries so that 
#            other issues can be isolated and reproduced.

#         - go through Workflow tools assumption many of you use python for personal projects maby not yet into packaging and publishing tools but still upload code to github 
#         and collaborate across public repos

#         -> poetry
#         -> pip-tools
#         -> conda: 
#            - conda can create sort of an environment file in the yaml format to distribute to others using also conda. Create it using: 
#               - conda list --explicit --export --md5 > environment.yml
#            - and then create a new environment with
#               - conda create -n <name> -f environment.yaml
#            - now you can share the yaml-file with everyone. If you only want to adapt to updates you need the following command:
#               - conda update --file environment.yml 
#            - you can alternatively actually use pip inside of conda and have access to many of pips features (although it can make it own problems)
#            - Condas biggest selling point is its large usage in scientific computing and AI. The big community with this focus uses conda and develops it with this use case in mind.

#This builds a big pile of libraries that accumulate in even smaller scripts to the point that it gave birth to a whole landscape of package management systems like pip, poetry, conda and much more.
#Most of the times the dependencies will be displayed in a requirements file or as a list of actively installed packages.
#But this only gives an impression of either the surface or the final picture.
#You won't know why a package X is ACTUALLY needed in your code if you did not actively imported it.
#Dependency Trees are a way to display all the packages your code needs, along with their path into the environment.
#
#Lets say you have two known dependencies for package A und B, a DT might look like this
#- A
#   - C
#   - D
#      - E
#- B
#   - C
#
#This gives a much clearer overview which package is actively installed and required and which is only a dependent.
#
#And while these structures are essential for the package management systems itself, most Developers do not keep track of them.
#But with them we can now see in detail which package forces us to use a certain Version of another package.
#This becomes very important if we come across vulnerabilities and want to update to a newer version.
#Because now we know which higher-leveled package we might actually need to update in order to increase the version of a dependent package.
#               
#Since this is such a relevant functionality for package management systems, they can (as far as we are aware) all produce them with ease.
